# Travel-fly About Page

## homework five

Another assignment showcasing media queries to create responsive site design, down to 800px of resolution. Really not too pleased with how the features on the page scale or even how the actual information on the page is laid out after the screen resolution is updated, but it looks functional enough I suppose..
